This follow-up to [Part I](http://neuropsychnow.com/2014/01/Backing_Up_Data) has been in the works for awhile. I was compelled to complete it after the recent failure of my Mac's file system structure. Basically, this amounted to a catastrophic failure of the entire machine. 

For almost everyone I've ever met, this kind of scenario would neither begin nor end well. A bulletproof backup strategy, though, will have you cueing images of [Alfred E. Neuman](#) rather than Woody Allen. 

Instead of covering varying degrees and types of backup strategies, I'm going to detail *my* strategy. Here is why: 

The day things quit working, I left my office at 5:02 PM. My final [incremental backup](#) ran at exactly 5:00, and I spent the two minutes in between basically shutting down applications and processes. The extra two minutes of file changes were handled by two other systems: [Dropbox](#) and [SpiderOak](#). When things finally were put right, my computer was in the *exact state* as it had been at 5:02 PM. So, no data loss. At all. The other important variable is that this strategy is compliant with the pertinent HIPAA Security and Privacy rules. 

Hopefully, your attention is piqued at this point. Let's get into the details.

## Hard Drive, meet Dolly

That's "Dolly," as in "Dolly - isn't that the name of that sheep clone or something?" Yes, that. Or something. 
While Dolly wasn't perfect, a clone of your computer's internal system disk is. More importantly, a clone is a *bootable* copy of your computer. This means that if/when your main computer is inoperable, you can simply plug in the cloned disk to another computer, boot *that* computer using a specific procedure,[^1] and carry on with your work while waiting for a repair or replacement. Not bad.
  
I clone my computer once per week, twice if I'm being good. Honestly, a daily clone is a better idea, but I'm too lazy for some reason. 

Despite the lack of frequent updates to my clone backup, I'm still not concerned about data loss. Why? Because I still have two other layers of backups that run throughout the day, every day. One of these is on-site, the other is off-site, or "in the cloud," as it were. 

## Being Super-HIPAA Compliant

...means extra work to restore things the way they were, but not *that* much extra work. The main problem, if you were further down the road than I was, would be to download 

## Nuanced

These are some of the other tasks that you may or may not have to complete in order to be back to 100%

Passwords
Store License keys (beware the UUID for programs like SPSS, which must be uninstalled from the old HDD first)
Set up accounts (Dropbox, iCloud, SpiderOak)
Reinstall and reconfigure applications
