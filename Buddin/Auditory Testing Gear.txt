Remember when you first learned about measuring auditory processing? You were told, in no uncertain terms, that the quality of the equipment that you used was important, right? Right??

No. No you were not. Allow us, then, to clarify the issue: the quality of the equipment that you use when assessing auditory processing is important. 

## A Quarter Note About Audio

I am a card carrying audiophile, but without the sanctimonious airs often accompanying this moniker. I am also a recovering gearhead from my days as a working musician. I started learning about live sound reinforcement when I was 14 years old, running the public address system for pep rallies and basketball games at my high school. Finally, to the consternation of my wife, I have enough spare cabling in my attic to simultaneously wire a small business and a home theater, with some to spare. ![My Cables. The ones *not* in use](/Users/Howard/Sites/bootstrap/img/howards-Cables.jpg). It is what it is. In varying degrees and forms, this is a hobby. Or an obsession in deep hibernation. Take your pick.

It should come as little surprise, then, that this all transferred over to the testing environment.
