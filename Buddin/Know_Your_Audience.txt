Report writing is a skill set that evolves over the course of a career. Among the many challenges of writing a sound report is tailoring it for the intended recipient. Of course, your patient is almost always the person for whom the report is written; however, our reports are generally filled with language that they would/do not understand. Moreover, the report gets sent to one or several other interested parties, including: 

1. Primary care physicians
2. Psychiatrists
3. School administration and/or teachers
4. Attorneys
5. Government agency
6. Judges 

Clearly, a wide array of individuals might be reading your report, each with a different level of knowledge and skill sets. They will also look at it in different ways, which are context-dependent. This adds another layer of complexity. Reports should, therefore, be written in a way that is meaningful to the party *most directly connected with the patient*. Understanding at the outset that there is no one correct format for report writing will eventually enhance your skill.


# The Patient #



# Primary Care Physician #



# Psychiatrist #

A psychiatrist is likely most interested in the patient's final diagnoses, as this will affect their treatment decisions, and so forth. 

# Attorney #

If writing a report for a forensic evaluation requested by an attorney, you are answering one or more very specific questions and are not offering recommendations for treatment. 

# Judge #

Occasionally, the patient will never get the report at all, as in the case of an Independent Medical Exam.

# Government Agency #



# School Administration and/or Teachers #

School psychologists are totally overworked. 

Now that we've got that out of the way
