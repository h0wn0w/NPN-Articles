## Future Assessment Kit - 4

### Prologue Is Prologue ###

Our patients depend on us for sound prognostication, which is not always easy. That is, until we got a hold of a private beta-test version of Psyche-Corp's Future Assessment Kit - 4 (FAKit -4). 

The FAKit -4 is a substantial improvement over its predecessor. Out of the gate, the FAKit -4 ships with much-improved data, starting with the normative sample (n = 20). This alone was almost enough to make us purchase the full clinical kit. According to the manual, the FAKit -4 also boasts the most reliable results yet. [^1]  

### The Goods ###

The FAKit-4 was delivered with fully updated stimulus materials and protocols. One of the more promising updates was that the test no longer requires a full MilliLiter/Cubic Centimeter of the patient's blood; a single drop is now all that is required. This was probably the most challenging part for clinicians and patients alike, particularly for those with blood/needle/hospital phobias. Consequently, the kit no longer requires voluminous quantities of chloroform and smelling salts, items that were never clinical but were necessary, costly, and, quite frankly, off-putting.[^2] 

The all new, re-designed, polymerase-injected Chicken BonesÂ© were a pleasure to work with, allowing us to interact with the Universal Ether across multiple planes of existence. Scattering them across the floor betrayed their distinctive weight and feel, certainly due in no small part to the use of micro-shellacking across the Bones' surface. Dr. Buddin's experiences with his patients were promising, though he noted some Bones occasionally seemed out of sync with their counterparts. 

Ultimately, we were compelled to conclude that the foretelling of our patients' prognosis was much easier than ever. Check it out for yourself - the FAKit-4 will be available beginning with the next Harvest Moon.

## The Other Test - Version# ##

Thanatos. Eros. Few constructs are so vital amongst neuropsychological measurements. Yet, interpreting the magnitude of a patient's Death Drive with existing measures has always been a cumbersome task. In pursuit of change, Creekeside Metrics has spent years in the research and development of a new measure designed to measure the balance of patients' compulsions to create or extinguish life. We were thrilled to get a sample of this new battery from Creekeside, the #TEST.

[^2]: Dr. Testa recalled administering four consecutive FAKit-2's a few years ago: "I was more than a little woozy at the end of the day from all of the Chloroform in the air. No matter how careful you are, you always end up breathing some of it in with each administration. Fortunately there was an empty examination room next to my office where I was able to sleep some of it off."
