Science is not free. In fact, journal subscriptions are incredibly expensive. If you are an individual wanting access to three journals -- let's say Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, The Clinical Neuropsychologist, and Brain -- for one year each, then be prepared to pay nearly $1600. Here is the breakdown of those three journals' current pricing:

* [ACN subscription](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/acn/access_purchase/price_list.html) = $376.00
* [TCN](http://www.tandfonline.com/pricing/journal/ntcn20#.UnSkiZTXRe8) = $630.00
* [Brain](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/brainj/access_purchase/price_list.html#note3) = $578.00

Total cost for individual subscriptions = $1584.00

The financial cost of obtaining science in the form of (generally) peer-reviewed journals impacts students, researchers, and clinicians, both independently and simultaneously. 

* *Students* do not have access to the complete body of literature in any field, anywhere. It's out there -- but no institution can afford to pay for it all. Ergo, students are on different playing fields as universities provide different, limited subsets of journals.
* *Researchers and academicians* suffer a similar fate, though whether or not they are affiliated with an institution is irrelevant. An additional problem is that they also may not have access to the very journal(s) in which they publish, though they may be expected to publish in journals with high [impact scores] in order to gain or maintain tenure.
* *Clinicians*, especially those who practice independently, are faced with an incomplete knowledge of the state of their field. Thus, the latest-and-greatest treatments may go unknown to them and, worst of all, to their patients.
