There is something about the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – IV (WAIS – IV) that just bugs the heck out of me. Actually, it was an issue on the WAIS-III, too.[^1] Actually, the thing that bugs me is 

just. 
one. 
single. 
item.

Stay with me for a minute here. It's time to get pedantic. It's time to talk about Albert Einstein. 

### Special Relativity

*Special Relativity* is first up. Basically, special relativity addresses the fact that the speed of light in a vacuum is stable/constant, regardless of where it came from or where it's going. 
I can recall an over-simplified version of this theory with the following mnemonic: 
> "S" is for "speed of light"

Okay, that's enough. I won't dare talk about this (or the following) theory any further, because I don't have the training to understand it in a meaningful way. Also, further discussion is t warranted. After all, I said I was going to get pedantic; one can hardly be pedantic *and* talk about one of the two theories of relativity.[^see] 

### General Relativity

*General Relativity* lays out the relationship between gravity's force (and the matter that it puts in motion) and four dimensions/axes: the three-dimensional physical world in which we live (the x, y, and z axes) and the fourth dimension of time. Collectively, these four dimensions are called *spacetime*.

To help me remember this and differentiate it from special relativity, I use another world-beater of a mnemonic:
>"G" as in "gravity" as in "general"

[^1]: That's as far back as I go so if this was the same deal on the WAIS-R I wouldn't know.

[^see]: At this point, some of you might know where I'm going with this.
