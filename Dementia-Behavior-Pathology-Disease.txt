With the DSM-{~~V~>5~~}, the term "dementia", at least for an "official" diagnosis, is gone!

The term "dementia" is {--a--}{>>@whb - 2013.06.22<<} frequently misused {--term--}{>>@whb - 2013.06.22<<}. The term has evolved to depict, **inaccurately**,{-- to depict--}{>>@whb - 2013.06.22<<} cognitive and functional decline of older adults that is permanent and progressive. Here are two examples that illustrate the point. First, someone can have Alzheimer's Disease, but not be "demented" yet. Second, a young person can sustain a traumatic brain injury that results in significant cognitive and functional decline. 

The concept and term dementia refers to:

>a state of acquired intellectual deterioration which significantly interferes with an individualâ€™s personal, social and occupational roles.

Importantly, someone with Alzheimer's disease (i.e. a behavioral and neuropathological entity) may or may not be classified as having "dementia". 

>The presence of dementia would then denote a stage of the disorder at which symptoms have become so severe that activities of daily living are significantly compromised.
