{==The APA Practice Central's page on [HIPAA compliance](http://apapracticecentral.org/business/hipaa/index.aspx) do we include this? I dislike the APA. Just saying.==}{>>@whb - 2013.09.04<<}

{--The --}{>>@whb - 2013.09.05<<}The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) guidelines established the [Privacy Rule](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/srsummary.html), which granted federal protection to protected health information (PHI). We're now preparing for a new change: the *HIPAA HITECH Act Final Rule 2013*. The HITECH (which stands for "Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health") Act's biggest change relates to entities referred to as "business associates." Basically, these are, e.g., companies such as billing clearinghouses that handle PHI. Even more basically, if you electronically transmit PHI to an organization that is *not* a healthcare entity, then they're a business associate. Some of the changes include:

* Introduction of liability for business associates 
* Enhanced restrictions on the sale of PHI, marketing, and fundraising communications
* Patients have greater power with respect to accessing their Electronic Medical Record and restricting who has access to certain information

The last bullet point is especially important, as it means that someone like a potential employer can't just get access to any part of your medical record - a big concern that was addressed during the creation of these rules and regulations.

This article is *not* meant to cover this act of Congress - please download the complete, 138-page document that discusses revisions [here](http://d.pr/f/N6nq) - as much as it is meant to serve as an introduction to the topic with a few (hopefully) helpful and actionable steps towards establishing or maintaining compliance. So, let's get started... 


## Broadly Speaking ##

So, what can you do to make sure that you're maintaining compliance? Step Zero is to get familiar, if you're not already, with the basics. The [HIPAA HITECH Act Final Rule 2013](http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/hitech-act-0) went into effect on March 26, 2013. If that date came and went without your knowledge of this sea-change, then count yourself among the majority. Probably in anticipation of this coupled with the shear need for a timeline for pragmatic implementation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) gave everyone six months to comply. That date, September 23, 2013, is nearly upon us. 


## Encryption ##

Encryption of PHI/data is the first, best way to prevent getting fined by the HHS. Interestingly, providers are not obligated under the [Breach Notification Rule](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/index.html) to report a breach to patients *if the data (PHI) are encrypted*. This is because it is presumed that the attacker is/will be unable to decrypt the data. This is a bit of a reach, as it presumes that security is all about whether or not encryption is used to protect the data, and how data are stored. The unfortunate reality is that data security is actually dependent on the tenacity of the attacker; if they perceive you as a target not worth the effort, they'll move on. If, however, they perceive your stored data as a great, big, orange carrot, worthy of redoubled efforts, then it may be only a matter of time. 

A chain is, after all, only as strong as its weakest link. 

Either way, providers that follow this basic security practice are definitely taking a big step in the right direction. Encrypt your HDD or "User" folder using programs like [True Crypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/ "TrueCrypt - Free Open-Source On-The-Fly Disk Encryption Software ...") or File Vault (for Mac OS X).

## De-Identifying PHI ##


* De-identifying PHI can also be very, very effective, especially since the HHS recommends it. In fact, they have a set of [guidelines](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html) to help with the process. 

## Protecting PHI in Other Ways ##

* Use a network secured with WPA2/PSK at your office AND home 
* Use Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
* Passwords
	* Use strong passwords
	* Use DIFFERENT passwords for EVERY account you have. No, this is not as easy as what you're used to. Yes, you will thank yourself for putting in the extra work now
	* Your computer should be password protected. Several applications are available to help you both create and manage strong passwords. Here are a few of them to help get you started:
		* [example1]()
		* [example2]()
		* [example3]()
* Harder To Implement, Better Security
	* Verify downloads using SHA5, PGP, or other [Public-Key encryption/authentication software]
	* Create a partition or use a separate volume for PHI (?). 
	    * This would actually be a really sweet idea. You could encrypt that drive and lock it up in a fireproof safe. Use of a scanner to convert all records to .pdf would have you in the clear right away. 
	    * This idea would not just *save* storage space, it would obviate the need for it altogether. 
	    * WHAT IF you had your patients fill out their information on a tablet computer while they were in the waiting room. Something easy. Basically, the idea would have to be that if they could fill out a form, they could type this in. Probably no good for several reasons, but just brainstorming. 
	* Use SFTP for file transfers whenever possible

## Things to Not Do ##


The following list of practices will probably NOT help you if you are audited:

* Storing your patients' PHI on Google Docs, SkyDrive, or equivalent service. This is just asking for trouble.
* Make me guess your password using a [Dictionary Attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack "Dictionary attack - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
* Use FTP (use SFTP instead - see above)

A lot has been covered in this post. In part two, the main points of the HIPAA guidelines will be covered. Afterward, we'll outline how can you get your practice or department up to HIPAA compliance standards.
