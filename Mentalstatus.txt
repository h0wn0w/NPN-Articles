We neuropsychologists perform repetitive tasks all day long....perseverative? Sometimes, it can feel that way. Luckily, there are great tools that make these jobs more automatic. One such tool is [Text Expander for Mac OS](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html). Text Expander allows you to pair "snippets" of text (like your address) with abbreviations that you create (like *”addy”*). So, instead of typing your address every time you need to, you can simply type *”addy”*, and voilà...your address appears.

One very handy feature of Text Expander is forms. This feature allows you to pair an abbreviation with a form-based snippet. So, suppose you wanted to create a form for the mental status section of your reports. The mental status portion is a great target for this, as its structure is fairly invariant across patients.[^1] Having a form-based mental status is ideal, as it can be completed very quickly with text expansion. 


Text Expander provides assistive menus to help create forms. So, you can write boilerplate statements like "GENDER was UN/ABLE to clearly articulate the reason for this evaluation," and Text Expander will help you create blank fields for "GENDER" and "UN/ABLE," which will allow you to fill those with the appropriate information when the time comes. Thus, when writing a Mental Status section you can type *”msout”* to generate the following form:


>Initial Abbreviation to activate snippet

![](../../img/abbrev.png)

Then, fill in as appropriate:
>Empty Form:

![](../../img/empt.png)


>Filled Form:

![](../../img/filled.png)


Note, when different fields have the same label, completing one field, fills in the rest (e.g. all fields with “*Gender*”, will be filled with “she”).

Once the form is complete, you can tailor the rest for the individual case:

>End result:

[^1]: Of course, some mental status evaluations will call for more or less supplemental information than others, but this can be added after the core sections have been written
