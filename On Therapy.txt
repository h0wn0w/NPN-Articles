I am doing therapy for the first time in about four years. The last time I did any kind of therapy was while on internship. 

I do not consider myself a particularly skilled therapist. I had the privilege of working with a couple of highly skilled therapists while on Fellowship. The depth and breadth of their knowledge was astounding. I find myself in the middle of a session remembering various methodologies, theories, techniques, etc. Nevertheless, I feel that I am growing as a therapist, even over just these past few, short months.
