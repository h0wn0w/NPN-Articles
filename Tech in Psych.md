## Goals ##

* Improve efficiency at all levels of experience
	1. Supervision for interns, externs, post docs: 
		* Why talk about honing workflow in psychology?
			* Any compensation you get for report-writing will be smaller than the amount of time you spend on a report.
			* Automaticity of workflow allows more reserve to focus on more important aspects of the report.
			* Does working efficiently result in diminished billing? According to a report writing and billing survey by Jacque Donders the average report writing time is about 7/10 of assessment hours. So 4 hours of testing and scoring will result in about 3 hours of report writing.
		* Understanding organizational aspects of reports to help improve written communication skills
	
	2. For experienced neuropsychologists/clinicians:
		* Still struggle with writing
		* Balancing helpfulness and hindrances of technology tools; learning how to enhance the work you do
		* prone to distraction/procrastination
		* ADHD characteristics?

* Management of data with tech
	1. What are the current best practices for the active storage, archiving, and transmission of EMR and other PHI?
		* The APA has its updated guidelines (2007?), which are decent, but as expected are somewhat vague and do not sufficiently keep pace with ever-changing security standards.
	2. How, if at all, worried should people be about patient data being compromised, stolen, etc. 
	3. How to truly be a scientist-paractitioner by databasing your own raw data to understand local patterns of test performance.
		* this may even be worth an SIG on its own....what are the best ways to collect clinical data to be analyzed locally or even shared with others...a common data elements for neuropsychology.
			* Big star for the above point - this is something I think we're both passionate about. It's also a topic that needs to be brought more to the forefront of NP's awareness

## Objectives and Means ##

* Special interest group (SIG) on technology and the practice of psychological report writing

* Free, downloadable resources - linked to the SIG above (?)
	1. Outline fundamental/overarching report-writing ideals
	2. Desktop and mobile applications that might be useful to neuropsychologists (I have actually started one of these based in part on a search of npsych topics)

* Open forums discussing what we find cognitively challenging
	* hopefully this would not get out of control like another listserv that we both know so well. 

* What should our reports include?
* Who are our “customers”?
	* Patients
	* physicians
	* attorneys
	* insurance companies?
* What do referral sources like or not like about neuropsychological reports?
* Is it necessary to spend time writing lengthy reports?
* How about a survey to determine report customer satisfaction?
	* AAN and APA (psychiatry) membership as targets?

* Submitting an ad or article to GradPsych, Monitor, APAGS etc. to attract student crowd.
* Link up to grad programs?
