# iPad Apps for Neuropsychologists

According to our Google Analytics stats, many Neuropsych Now visitors use an iPad. While the iPad is thought of as a consumption device for viewing movies, browsing the internet, reading news items, and reading PDFs, there are a number of ways the iPad can be used for creation and getting work done. This article highlights well-designed and functional apps that iPad-using neuropsychologists may find extremely useful. As the goal is to improve our everyday, native, executive functions, and most readers here are neuropsychologists, breaking down the apps by various cognitive domains may serve as a useful schema.

Before reviewing how the iPad can be used to improve our functioning, it will be useful to review what the iPad ain't so great at. Toward the top of the list is the type of change  tracking that can be accomplished in {>>Microsoft<<}{>>added@whb - 2014.02.25<<} Word. While this can be accomplished in various apps like Office HD, etc., it is not a  smooth process. [Pages](!g) can be used, in a pinch but, again, the execution is lacking and some work may be better accomplished with a mouse and full size keyboard. {++

Planning, organization, reasoning and creativity, prospective memory, task management, and long term memory can all be enhanced using iPad apps. Many of these apps are available for iPhone and Android devices.

### Drafts ###

[Drafts][1] is an app that can be used to capture information in the form of text that you want to act on in various ways. {++Think of it as both a starting point and temporary holding station for notes, text-based ideas, or emails. Each time Drafts is launched, the user is shown a blank, white screen. Next, a note is entered, and the user chooses one of several pre-configured actions, or custom actions, to apply.++}{>>@whb - 2014.02.25<<} These actions, which in actuality are small programs for interacting with other apps, and are based on [URL schemes](http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts/). For instance, if you need to keep track of time for billing purposes, you can open Drafts, type in the name of the project you are working on (e.g., Attorney X) and configure Drafts to add automatically "Start: YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM", and then send the entire line of text with to a pre-specified file in Dropbox, Evernote, or a variety of other apps. As dictation can be used in Drafts, it is easy to dictate a note that can then be sent to an email application, a plain text file, or to be sent as a text message. Obviously, you can open a specific app to accomplish each of these task, but if you always have the same starting point, the workflow is much smoother. In addition, as you learn to use Drafts, there are more complex and automated tasks that can be performed.
