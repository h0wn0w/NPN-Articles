Many, if not most, of us carry some type of mobile device with us throughout the day, everyday. These platforms are used, broadly, for an increasing number of functions that were not possible (or imagined as possible, for that matter) less than a decade ago. They are now ubiquitous to a point that they may be taken for granted, their possible uses left unexplored by the masses. Is it possible that one of the roles that could be played is that of cognitive assistive tool? More to the point, can we use them to enhance our thinking, productivity, and/or our effectiveness as clinicians?

Of course! And, um, it depends!

1. We do everyday

## Clinical Applications

Mobile and other tech devices can be used to enhance our patients' well--being. The majority of our patients already have smartphones and/or tablets of various makes and models, and we can help them learn ways to use it to their advantage. 

The most basic usage cases for "mobile training" take established paradigms, precepts, and recommendations and simply translate them to a digital substrate. These involve getting your patients warmed up to the idea that they may benefit from:

* Habitually using a calendar or reminder app for important tasks or events
* Setting alarms for one-time uses
* Using a built-in notes application or text editor for quickly capturi important information
* Using text messaging to keep a record of important conversations with others. 

Educating and "training" patients to do these things can be implemented during a single feedback session, or over the course of a prescribed rehabilitation. There are many variables, of course, that will dictate the "what, when, why, how, where" elements of device usage. Below are some broad cases and potential implementations. Aspects of these are taken from aggregates of actual, clinical scenarios we have encountered.

Hemiparesis after a stroke can be mediated with several tactics. Assuming the individual has not suffered a dramatic impairment of speech, they can use dictation in place of typing.
