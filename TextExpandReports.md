Several months ago I started using [TextExpander](!g) to help make writing neuropsychological reports a little easier. To me, this made incredibly good sense. At the time, I didn't really have a full sense about the depth and breadth of this application. I started by taking words I often used and created snippets with them. Words like "neuropsychological," "neurocognitive," and "hypertension" were good first targets. I quickly moved on to longer phrases, like "Durable Power of Attorney" and "The patient's medical history is positive for". Here are the abbreviations for each of these, in order: 

<code>
`,nl` = neuropsychological  
`,ng` = neurocognitive  
`htn` = hypertension  
`,dpa` = Durable Power of Attorney  
`mdhx` = The patient's medical history is positive for  
</code>

The next step to all of this is creating a kind of dynamic system for generating the structure (and *some* of the content) for an entire neuropsychological report. Here's how that goes down. For an outpatient report, I open a blank document (no template files required!) and type the following: 

`,skelout`

These eight characters yield the following (screenshots):
