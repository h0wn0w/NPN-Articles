We recently ran across [this](http://neuropsychologytoolkit.com/report-writing) article about neuropsychologists' report writing characteristics.[^1] Included are some facts that we're all more or less aware of. Most poignant for us was the amount of time we spend writing our reports versus the likelihood that our audience will actually *read* any of them beyond the summary section. This disparity is, in large part, why we work to reduce the amount of time spent writing reports. 

Included are templates for download.
