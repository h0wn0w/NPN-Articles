What are we diagnosing?

Our job is to measure cognitive ability, attempt to determine what may be contributing to a patient's dysfunction, and make recommendations for their future well-being. The results of a neuropsychological assessment describe a person's abilities and weaknesses in a way that can help the patient, their family, and other care providers understand them in ways that will improve their quality of life. In many ways a description is more useful than a diagnosis. This may come as a surprise to many, since we are all trained to diagnose and categorize patients based on our test results. A diagnosis, however, can only go so far. What do you do with a person who has "Alzheimer's" or "Frontotemporal Dementia"? Though we could guess what deficits to expect, the labels do not provide any information about what the individual person struggles with, what their family has noticed, or what we can recommend for their care. If you are lucky, you may hear a supervisor say "diagnoses are for billing and insurance companies". It's true.
