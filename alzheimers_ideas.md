An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (AD). This includes approximately 200,000 individuals with early onset AD (under the age of 65; Alzheimer's Association, 2012). The definition of AD, however, is changing. McKhann, et al. (2011) have proposed a sweeping restructuring of the original criteria, which were codified in 1984, based on well-documented research that has led to a dramatic change in both our understanding and conceptualization of AD as a disease and syndrome. 

## Memory Impairment as a Defining Characteristic?

Although memory impairment is and has been the primary defining feature of AD, it is unlikely that it will continue to be a necessary (it has never been sufficient) condition when diagnosing AD (Mckhann, 2011). Indeed, on the table is the definition for a *non-amnestic* type, which may end up being Including what we now refer to as Posterior Cortical Atrophy, or PCA. Other non-amnestic presentations might include impairments in language or executive functioning. 

## Use of Genetic Biomarkers

Advances that have occurred since the original establishment of Alzheimer's criteria include biomarkers as indicators of possible AD. Specifically, genetic mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 and biomarkers including amyloid-beta protein and tau/p-tau are measured, when possible, to assist with diagnosis. The presence of these biomarkers has demonstrated good reliability and validity in establishing a positive diagnosis of AD.
