A large part of our job here at Neuropsych Now is to help you increase your efficiency at work. Specifically, our mission is to help fine-tune your work on and with the various computers and devices that you use on a day-to-day basis. To this end, we watch colleagues, co-workers, friends and loved ones interact with their desktop and laptop computers all the time. Sometimes watching these person-machine interactions can be difficult for us. Sometimes they can be the visual analogue of nails on a chalkboard. Why? 

{{Some of these observations are difficult for us because we know (or at least believe) that there's a better way; however, it's not just about saying "we think this is better because it's what *we* do." We have evidence. *Empirical* evidence. We are, after all, neuropsychologists just like you. }}{>>this might be cut<<} 

One of the things we know is that using keyboard shortcuts (or keybindings if you're willing to *really* go down the rabbit hole) to navigate your way through an application or program is nearly always faster than using a mouse or trackpad to accomplish the same task. 

The degree to which one method of command entry differs from another has been studied by members of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (Omanson, Miller, Young & Schwantes, 2010). The point is that keyboard entry requires recall of the correct key(s), followed by key presses. By comparison, use of a mouse potentially requires many more steps. Consider the following steps in the table below. 

| Key versus Click	|	|  
| Keyboard Entry	| Mouse/Trackpad Entry	|  
| :----------	| :-----------	|  
| 1. Recall command key	| 1. Determine which menu contains item	|  
| 2. Hold control key	| 2. Look for menu	|  
| 3. Press command key	| 3. Point to menu	|  
|	| 4. Click mouse	|  
|	| 5. Look for item	|  
|	| 6. Point to item	|  
|	| 7. Click mouse	|

To be sure, the table presented above (a) does not apply in all situations, and (b) is reductionistic. Nevertheless, it provides a good comparison of the cognitive and motoric requirements of the two entry methods. Here's a plausible real-world example for the sake of discussion:
>Person A asks if either Person B or Person C can help her retrieve a book located somewhere in their office. Person B can describe to Person A where it is with 100% precision. Person B, however, must take Person A by the hand, walk them down the hall to the room where the book is located, and point directly to the book. 

It goes without saying that the former of these is inherently more efficient. Person B's method is akin to a keyboard shortcut. Person C's is more like using a mouse or trackpad.

Nearly all applications/programs/apps that you use on a day-to-day basis have keyboard shortcut equivalents to their menu counterparts. It's likely that you're already familiar with some of these: `Cmd/Ctrl + S` (Mac/Windows) for "Save," `Cmd/Ctrl + C` for "Copy," `Cmd/Ctrl + V` for "Paste," and so on. Software developers, unfortunately, do not always make keyboard shortcuts known or obvious to you, the end-user. It's likely that this is at least part of the problem behind learning them for some. 

Whatever the reason you may have for not learning some time-saving keystrokes, we humbly suggest you dive into your favorite (or most often-used) program's menu bar and/or instruction manual. Try and find out what the various keyboard shortcuts are, and try them out. You'll be surprised at how quickly they will become part of your "muscle memory," *and* at how much time a few well-placed commands can save you.
