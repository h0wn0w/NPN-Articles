The presence of computers and, more recently mobile devices, has changed the landscape of healthcare forever. This is a good thing, but it's not (yet) a *great* thing. What do we mean by this? Well, let's throw a little thesis out there to guide this thought experiment. It's broken into Part I (this article) and II (TBA).

Part I

1. Federally mandated move to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems
2. Hamstrung: EMR
3. Emergence of mobile tech
4. Complications and shortcomings of HIPAA
	1. Address protected health information security risks
	2. HITECH
	3. 2013: Updates & Changes 

Part II

5. Hamstrung: institutions balk
6. Hamstrung: clinicians ignore and/or are unsure of what/how to use

Part I

The Federal Government mandated back in 2003 that medical institutions must all move to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) but quick. This led to a surge of some of the worst software ever written by software companies that were trying to fill a new need while simultaneously taking advantage of a new stream of revenue.[^1] 





[^1]: We don't take issue with such enterprise; they have to pay the bills, too. It's really all about discordance between EMR packages.
