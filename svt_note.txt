Title:				A Note About Validity Testing

Validity testing is probably the single most discussed and controversial topic in the field of neuropsychology. 

And we're never going to address it on Neuropsych Now.

There are several reasons for this decision. Probably the simplest reason is that Neuropsych Now is a completely public forum, and validity testing is not a topic fit for public forums. It really starts and ends there. 

As neuropsychologists, it's tough to not be able to write or talk about something that's so central to our profession. It really is the only decision, though. We hope you'll not only understand, but agree with, this choice. 

Thanks again for reading, and please keep coming back!
