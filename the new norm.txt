The practice and trade of neuropsychology is built on the assessment of brain-behavior relationships. We come up through training learning the cornerstone tools of assessment of global intellectual abilities, memory, executive functioning, and so forth. It's safe to say, even without knowing how all programs train and educate their students, that we learn about the process of gathering and applying population-based norms to test results. The application of the results at the subtest and domain level, in isolation of other tests, is relatively simple: convert a raw score to a standard score using each test's respective normative data set. More often than not, the derived score comes from a conversion that has been stratified according to age. Other times scores are further parsed by education and ethnicity. Tests whose scores are derived from normative tables that account for each of those three variables (age, education, and ethnicity) are relatively few and far between, but probably do a better job "leveling the playing field" from a neurocognitive perspective. This is obviously incredibly reductionistic, but it's sufficient for the focus of this article.  

We need to re-think this method of deriving and applying scores.

Scores for many of our tests are derived from a sample whose data have been so systematically altered that they are "super-normative," and don't apply to *anyone*. Through processes like application of exclusionary criteria and mean-centering[^1], data are converted, parsed, and culled in such a way that may obscure or distort a person's true ability.

Regression-based norms are derived in an entirely different way. Whereas population-based norms are more or less descriptive statistics, the regression-based approach employs inferential statistics to derive (an) equation(s) that weight demographic variables of interest.
